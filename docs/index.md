# MODA Templates

EMMC and EMCC as well as related projects have been engaged in actions to define a classification and formal documentation of materials modelling and characterisation, the MODA and CHADA. However, these are free text documents with only a very high level structure defined. To make these more computer readable, lower level structures guiding the development of metadata standards and ontological annotation is considered by NanoCommons and the latter is tested on some examples here. However, this page is meant __only to test some ideas on how to annotate the text and collect needed ontology terms to then be pushed into the Elementary Multiperspective Material Ontology (EMMO) or eNanoMapper Ontology.__ Please consider this page as something temporary not to be used, including the tested concepts or technical realisations, in production.
